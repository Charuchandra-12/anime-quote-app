# anime-quote-app

In this DevOps project, I integrated a custom anime quotes app, showcasing my ability to blend creative and technical skills. I utilized Google Cloud Platform, focusing on Google Kubernetes Engine, for robust app deployment. The creation and implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using GCP tools were central, ensuring efficient and continuous delivery. Additionally, I've created a YouTube video walkthrough to share insights into the project's development and deployment process.
