# aws acc.setup
# statefile management
# script for all installation is pending
# github pipeline code pending (make new docker image and upload to dockerhub) and then pull the the above script part
# setup for custom domain maybe only nginx revers proxi will do no need to implement that jenkins.conf part over here



# I guess when I bulild the new dockerimage from the piepline I will need to change the connections in the prometheus helm chart's value and this will be more headache so better leave it for now for this project.  

# maybe prometheus setup if added then add helm chart, prometheus, grafana and alert setup in the project description.

# after doing all the above just check like add some console.log and then check the pipline and other than app rest of the installations should be as it is.
