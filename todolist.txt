# aws acc.setup
# statefile management
# manull setup for Route53 and nameservers of Hostinger
# script for all installation and setup for custom domain like changing the cofig file for ngixn is pending and run the app in minkkube cluster 2 replicas
# github pipeline code pending (make new docker image and upload to dockerhub) and then pull the the above script part



# I guess when I bulild the new dockerimage from the piepline I will need to change the connections in the prometheus helm chart's value and this will be more headache so better leave it for now for this project.  

# maybe prometheus setup if added then add helm chart, prometheus, grafana and alert setup in the project description.

# after doing all the above just check like add some console.log and then check the pipline and other than app rest of the installations should be as it is.
